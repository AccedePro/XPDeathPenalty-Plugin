# XPDeathPenalty

*RAW CODE ONLY*

Minecraft Version: (1.16.*)

XPDeathPenalty is a Minecraft Sponge/SpongeForge server plugin designed to drop XP on death when KeepInventory is enabled. This is to counter-balance the effect of keeping one's inventory while also adding in some negative reinforcement on survival-multiplayer servers.

There is no plugin config file as I attempted to make this plugin as lightweight as possible.

It is highly recommended you use this plugin with a paper-spigot server as paper enables you to respawn the dragon egg with each dragon death (check paper.yml in server folder). 

It is planned that I add a plugin configuration file, but at this time, I currently have no time to get this done. Along with other things, it will happen eventually, as well as bugfixes and additional features.

It should also be noted that this project is currently *UNFINISHED.*

Furthermore, I know my programming is probably inefficient, cut me some slack.
