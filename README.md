# XPDeathPenalty-Plugin
Minecraft Sponge/SpongeForge server plugin to drop XP on death when KeepInventory is enabled.

To build .jar, load the file system into Intellij and run the gradle build. Output will be in the build\libs folder which can then be directly copied into the server plugins folder.

There are quite a few known bugs... please cut me some slack I only smol boi :(
